# connect-memjs

  Memcached session store forked from using [connect-memcached](https://github.com/balor/connect-memcached), using [memjs](https://github.com/alevy/memjs) as the underlying memcached client.

  This enables faster binary transport and authentication, which is needed to use the [Memcachier](https://www.memcachier.com) service.

  Many thanks to [balor](https://github.com/balor) who wrote the original implementation - this module simply swaps out the memcached client.

## Installation

  via npm:

      $ npm install connect-memjs

## Example

      /**
      * Module dependencies.
      */

      var express = require('express')
        , session = require('express-session')
        , favicon = require('serve-favicon')
        , logger = require('morgan')
        , cookieParser = require('cookie-parser')
        , http = require('http')
        , app = express();

      // pass the express to the connect memcached module
      // allowing it to inherit from express.session.Store
      var MemcachedStore = require('connect-memjs')(session);

      app.use(favicon());

      // request logging
      app.use(logger());

      // required to parse the session cookie
      app.use(cookieParser());

      // Populates:
      // - req.session
      // - req.sessionStore
      // - req.sessionID (or req.session.id)

      var store = new MemcachedStore({servers: ['127.0.0.1:1121'], username: 'liam', password: 'hunter2'});
      app.use(session({ 
        secret: 'CatOnTheKeyboard', 
        store: store
      }));

      app.get('/', function(req, res){
        if (req.session.views) {
          ++req.session.views;
        } else {
          req.session.views = 1;
        }
        res.send('Viewed <strong>' + req.session.views + '</strong> times.');
      });

      http.createServer(app).listen(3000, function(){
        console.log('Express app started on port 3000');
      });

## Options

    - `servers` Memcached servers locations, as an array of strings.
    - `username` An optional username to authenticate with
    - `password` An optional password to authenticate with
    - `prefix` An optional prefix for each memcache key, in case you are sharing 
               your memcached servers with something generating its own keys. 
    - ...     Rest of given option will be passed directly to the node-memcached constructor.
